# data-analysts-full-project-adalab

Data for this exercises will be extracted from the API https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#introduction
(Basketball database). It doesn't require registration nor API Key.

## Data ingestion: 
Create a python script that will retrieve data from the API and will store it as files in the local filesystem.

#### Exercise 1: 
Get all teams. https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#get-all-teams
Bear in mind pagination. It is possible to pass additional arguments to the API call. 

#### Exercise 2: 
It is required to obtain all matches of the 1991-1992 season. No need to rename/remove fields from the response.

#### Exercise 3: 
Extract the season_averages for the season 2014-2015 for the players below:

- Pau Gasol (playerID = 170)
- Lebron James (playerID = 237)
- Stephen Curry (playerID = 115)


#### Output/ Deliverables:
- Create one reusable (shared across exercises) python function that will handle the pagination of the API
- Exercise 1: One JSON file containing all teams in the folder `/data/teams`
- Exercise 2: One JSON file per match in the folder `/data/matches`
- Exercise 3: One JSON file containing stats for the 3 players in the folder `/data/stats`
- Pagination must be dynamic. i.e. control pagination until the end.
- Git repository must not contain any JSON files


Key Points:
Pagination. Each API call contains metadata that you can use to control it.

`'meta': {'total_pages': 2, 'current_page': 1, 'next_page': 2, 'per_page': 30, 'total_count': 45}`
Iteration
API Search/Query: Read the docs carefully

#### Tools:
- Python / Jupyter
- requests https://pypi.org/project/requests/


## Data transformation: 
Create a python script that will convert the previously generated JSON files into flattened CSV files.

Alternatively, this exercise can be done with Penthaho Community Edition.
